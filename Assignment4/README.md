MIRROR MODE DOES NOT WORK.
I asked for  extension but  did not  use it because I am not 100% sure how to fix it. I went to the  tutoring center  and was helpful for me to finish some of the problems that I  was facing but couldn't finish  the full task.

I added bunch of strings to figure  out  where my error is happening
